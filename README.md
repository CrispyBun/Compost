# Compost
Compost is a Lua library for component-based development (CBD).
It is designed to be conceptually easy to grasp for people familiar with OOP, while replacing inheritance with composition.

Compost puts importance on [single-responsibility principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and [polymorphism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)), providing features to easily achieve both.
